Telco Customer Churn Analysis
Project Objective
This project analyzes telecommunications customer data to identify the key factors leading to customer churn. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations to help the company improve customer retention and service quality.

Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is the public Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, which includes information on customer demographics, services, and account details.

Tools and Technologies
R Programming Language: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

RStudio: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

ggplot2: A popular R library used for creating high-quality, effective data visualizations.

Key Findings
Our exploratory data analysis revealed the following main drivers of customer churn:

Contract Type: Customers with month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those with one-year or two-year contracts.

Tenure: The majority of customer churn occurs within the first few months of service. Long-term customers show a strong loyalty trend.

Internet Service: The highest churn rate is found among customers who use Fiber optic service.

Monthly Charges: Customers who churned generally have higher monthly charges than those who did not.

Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend the company should:

Offer incentives to encourage customers with monthly contracts to switch to longer-term plans.

Improve the onboarding process and customer support for new customers, especially during their first 6 months.

Investigate and resolve potential quality issues with the Fiber optic service.
